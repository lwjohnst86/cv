          details: >
            Create a project directory structure, along with typical files
            for that project.  This allows projects to be quickly and easily created,
            as well as for them to be standardized. Designed specifically with scientists
            in mind (mainly bio-medical researchers, but likely applies to other fields).
    github:
        - pkg: "[mason](https://github.com/lwjohnst86/mason)"
          details: >
            Use a consistent syntax to create data structures of common
            statistical techniques that can be continued in a magrittr pipe chain.
            Design the analysis, add settings and variables, construct the results, and
            polish the final structure. Rinse and repeat for any number of statistical
            techniques.
        - pkg: "[seer](https://github.com/lwjohnst86/seer)"
          details: >
            Become a seer of data to gain insights into the structure of
            your results. Use a common syntax to quickly create commonly used plots
            from analyses. Uses the output from the mason package.
        - pkg: "[carpenter](https://github.com/lwjohnst86/carpenter)"
          details: >
            Easily create tables commonly used in scientific papers.

            Convert statistical analysis objects from R into tidy data frames,
            so that they can more easily be combined, reshaped and otherwise processed
            with tools like 'dplyr', 'tidyr' and 'ggplot2'. The package provides
            three S3 generics: tidy, which summarizes a model's statistical findings
            such as coefficients of a regression; augment, which adds columns to the
            original data such as predictions, residuals and cluster assignments; and glance,
            which provides a one-row summary of model-level statistics.
