        The [UofTCoders](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/) members were hired
        by CUPE3902 Unit 5 to teach Python to post-doctoral fellows. As a core
        member of the UofTCoders, I acted as a helper to the instructors at the
        three-part workshop series introducing the Python programming language.
        Duties were to answer any questions and fix any problems that novice
        learners encountered during the Python sessions.

    title: Departmental R workshops
    org: "[Code As Manuscript](http://codeasmanuscript.org)"
    details: >
        I wanted to increase the computing capacity of my graduate department and
        to start to promote a culture of code-sharing and code reviews. Since how
        analyses are conducted and what the code is to create the scientific results
        is increasingly becoming more important, I wanted to start teaching students
        how to use R efficiently and productively. I've also set up a code review
        with my lab, so it was efficient for me to wrap these workshops up with the
        code reviews.

        I started this workshop series in the Department of Nutritional Sciences and eventually
        got it approved for teaching in the GPS program. Initially I taught with
        colleague Dr. Daiva Nielsen and we taught graduate
        students SAS coding and computing skills. I now teach R and Git,
        having co-instructed with Sarah Meister.
        We teach version control, beginner and advanced coding techniques, and
        how to structure research projects around the idea of reproducibility.
        Consistent with our mission statement, our material is publicly available online
        at http://github.com/codeasmanuscript/workshops.
