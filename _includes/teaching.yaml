    details: >
        I wanted to increase the computing capacity of my graduate department and
        to start to promote a culture of code-sharing and code reviews. Since how
        analyses are conducted and what the code is to create the scientific results
        is increasingly becoming more important, I wanted to start teaching students
        how to use R efficiently and productively. I've also set up a code review
        with my lab, so it was efficient for me to wrap these workshops up with the
        code reviews.
