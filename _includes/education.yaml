#    Taking instructor training from Software Carpentry, an organization that is
#    aimed at providing training in the form of workshops for researchers and
#    scientists to teach computing and programming skills. These skills are
#    increasingly becoming important as our society and science in general enter
#    in the digital age, where datasets are becoming larger and reproducible
#    analyses are being required to maintain scientific rigor. My profile on the
#    training website is found at:
