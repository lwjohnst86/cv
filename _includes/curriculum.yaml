      title: "Code as Manuscript: Data wrangling, visualization, and reproducibility in R"
      org: Graduate Professional Skills Program, University of Toronto, Canada
      details: >
            Developed a multi-day workshop series on initially SAS with colleague
            Dr. Daiva Nielsen and later I developed a series on R. These workshops
            aimed to teach scientific coding skills to graduate students, such
            as using version control, structuring research projects, using
            reproducibility concepts, and "software development" concepts in
            a scientific coding context. The material is publicly available online
            at https://github.com/codeasmanuscript.
