        Creator. The goal of PROMISE.scrub is to provide functions that help
        with cleaning and preparing the PROMISE dataset for eventual use in
        analyses and research projects. There are several of these packages that
        all work to make it easier to handle the different needs of preparing
        the PROMISE dataset, at least from a data management point of view, to
        be trustworthy and of sufficient quality control.

      description: |
        Creator. The aim of this package is to run audits on datasets to check
        for errors or typos in values. For instance, with a column called
        MonthsPerYear, the values should be integers that go from 1 to 12. If
        there are violations to this pattern, the values need to be investigated
        at the raw data source. This is a companion package to the main PROMISE
        package.

        Contributor. Summarizes key information about statistical objects in
        tidy tibbles. This makes it easy to report results, create plots and consistently
        work with large numbers of models at once. Broom provides three verbs that each
        provide different types of information about a model. `tidy()` summarizes information
        about model components such as coefficients of a regression. `glance()` reports
        information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit measures like AIC and
        BIC. `augment()` adds information about individual observations to a dataset, such
        as fitted values or influence measures.

I've also set up a code review with my lab, so it was efficient for me to wrap these workshops up with the code reviews.

        Creator. I built, as well as occasionally maintain, the PROMISE cohort database.
        It originally had no organization or structure, with files across different computers
        and with different names. I applied data engineering practices to structure it into
        a pipeline that checks, validates, re-organizes, and FAIR-ifies the data. Setting it
        up as an (unpublished) R package made it easier to test, fix, validate,
        reuse, and share it with other researchers using PROMISE data.

      Developed a multi-day workshop series on initially SAS with colleague
      Dr. Daiva Nielsen and later I developed a series on R. These workshops aimed to
      teach scientific coding skills to graduate students, such as using version control,
      structuring research projects, using reproducibility concepts, and "software development"
      concepts in a scientific coding context.
