        method documentation. This is a companion package to the main PROMISE

      description: |
        Creator. The aim of this package is to run audits on datasets to check
        for errors or typos in values. For instance, with a column called
        MonthsPerYear, the values should be integers that go from 1 to 12. If
        there are violations to this pattern, the values need to be investigated
        at the raw data source. This is a companion package to the main PROMISE
        package.

      description:
        Contributor. Summarizes key information about statistical objects in
        tidy tibbles. This makes it easy to report results, create plots and consistently
        work with large numbers of models at once. Broom provides three verbs that each
        provide different types of information about a model. <code>tidy()</code> summarizes information
        about model components such as coefficients of a regression. <code>glance()</code> reports
        information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit measures like AIC and
        BIC. <code>augment()</code> adds information about individual observations to a dataset, such
        as fitted values or influence measures.

        Creator. I built, as well as occasionally maintain, the PROMISE cohort database.

        a pipeline that checks, validates, re-organizes, and FAIR-ifies the data. Setting it
