      description: Contributor. Summarizes key information about statistical objects in
        tidy tibbles. This makes it easy to report results, create plots and consistently
        work with large numbers of models at once. Broom provides three verbs that each
        provide different types of information about a model. tidy() summarizes information
        about model components such as coefficients of a regression. glance() reports
        information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit measures like AIC and
        BIC. augment() adds information about individual observations to a dataset, such
        as fitted values or influence measures.

        I wanted to increase the computing capacity of my graduate department and to start to promote a culture of code-sharing and code reviews. Since how analyses are conducted and what the code is to create the scientific results is increasingly becoming more important, I wanted to start teaching students how to use R efficiently and productively. I've also set up a code review with my lab, so it was efficient for me to wrap these workshops up with the code reviews.
