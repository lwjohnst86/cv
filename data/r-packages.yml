- title: 'broom: Convert Statistical Objects into Tidy Tibbles'
  description: Contributor. Summarizes key information about statistical objects in
    tidy tibbles. This makes it easy to report results, create plots and consistently
    work with large numbers of models at once. Broom provides three verbs that each
    provide different types of information about a model. tidy() summarizes information
    about model components such as coefficients of a regression. glance() reports
    information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit measures like AIC and
    BIC. augment() adds information about individual observations to a dataset, such
    as fitted values or influence measures.

- title: 'prodigenr: Research Project Directory Generator'
  description: Creator. Create a project directory structure, along with typical files
    for that project.  This allows projects to be quickly and easily created, as well
    as for them to be standardized. Designed specifically with scientists in mind
    (mainly bio-medical researchers, but likely applies to other fields).

- title: 'NetCoupler: Inference of Causal Links Between a Network and an External
    Variable'
  description: Creator. The 'NetCoupler' algorithm identifies potential direct effects
    of correlated, high-dimensional variables formed as a network with an external
    variable. The external variable may act as the dependent/response variable or
    as an independent/predictor variable to the network.

- title: 'mason: Build Data Structures for Common Statistical Analysis'
  description: Creator. Use a consistent syntax to create data structures of common
    statistical techniques that can be continued in a pipe chain.  Design the analysis,
    add settings and variables, construct the results, and polish the final structure.
    Rinse and repeat for any number of statistical techniques.
