  description: Developed a multi-day workshop series on initially SAS with colleague
    Dr. Daiva Nielsen and later I developed a series on R. These workshops aimed to
    teach scientific coding skills to graduate students, such as using version control,
    structuring research projects, using reproducibility concepts, and "software development"
    concepts in a scientific coding context.
