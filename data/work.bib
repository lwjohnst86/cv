  abstract    = {Specific serum fatty acid (FA) profiles predict the development of incident type 2 diabetes; however, limited longitudinal data exist exploring their role in the progression of insulin sensitivity (IS) and beta-cell function.To examine the longitudinal associations of the FA composition of serum phospholipid (PL) and cholesteryl ester (CE) fractions with IS and beta-cell function over 6-years.The Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort is a longitudinal observation study, with clinic visits occurring every 3 years. Three visits have been completed, totaling 6-years of follow-up.Individuals (n=477) at-risk for diabetes recruited from the general population in London and Toronto, Canada.Values from an oral glucose tolerance test were used to compute 1/HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index (ISI) for IS, and the Insulinogenic Index over HOMA-IR (IGI/IR) and the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) for beta-cell function. Thin-layer-chromatograph and gas-chromatograph quantified FA. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used for the analysis.IS and beta-cell function declined by 8.3-19.4% over 6-years. In fully adjusted GEE models, PL cis-vaccenate (18:1n-7) was positively associated with all outcomes, while gamma-linolenate (GLA; 18:3n-6) and stearate (18:0) were negatively associated with IS. Tests for time interactions revealed PL eicosadienoate (20:2n-6) and palmitate (16:0), and CE dihomo-gamma-linolenate (20:3n-6), GLA, and palmitate had stronger associations with the outcomes after longer follow-up.In a Canadian population at-risk for diabetes, we found that higher PL stearate and GLA, and lower cis-vaccenic acid, predicted consistently lower IS and beta-cell function over 6-years.},
