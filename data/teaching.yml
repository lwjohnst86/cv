    I wanted to increase the computing capacity of my graduate department and to start to promote a culture of code-sharing and code reviews. Since how analyses are conducted and what the code is to create the scientific results is increasingly becoming more important, I wanted to start teaching students how to use R efficiently and productively. I've also set up a code review with my lab, so it was efficient for me to wrap these workshops up with the code reviews.
