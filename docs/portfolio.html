<!--
# Overview/abstract

Optionally give a quick statement summarizing the portfolio. What makes it/you
special?
-->
<div id="teaching-philosophy" class="section level1">
<h1>Teaching philosophy</h1>
<!--
The teaching philosophy serves a number of functions, including:

1. clarifying your conceptualization of good teaching,
2. providing a rationale for your teaching behaviour, and
3. offering a thesis or conceptual framework for your portfolio, thus providing a focus

In addition, it can function as a tool for your own personal and professional
development as a teacher by helping you become more aware of your values,
strategies, objectives and teaching goals.

We therefore recommend that you introduce the commented examples in the section
below with a teaching philosophy statement that helps align your view of
teaching and rationale with your didactic choices. Remember to stay focused on
how you enhance student learning.
-->
<div id="why-do-you-teach-the-way-you-do" class="section level2">
<h2>Why do you teach the way you do?</h2>
<p>What is good teaching? To me, good teaching is the <em>facilitation</em> of skill and knowledge development in learners, conducted in a safe and supportive environment where learning encompasses, as much as possible, what will be encountered in real world settings and conditions. Good teaching will result in gaining skills and knowledge that persist over time and that are used in settings outside of the teaching environment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I believe that good teaching should be about helping to create a better society.</p>
<p>My definition of good teaching shapes and informs why I teach the way I do. For the majority of my teaching activities, I primarily teach scientific data analysis skills and knowledge to current and future researchers (ranging from undergraduate to postdoc and even some professors). How I teach these topics comes from what I believe is good teaching. For these teaching sessions, I generally use a participatory live coding<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> style interspersed with hands-on exercises and occasional lectures with slides. If I can, I include group work as a project assignment.</p>
<p>I use these techniques for several reasons. Firstly, humans evolved to use tools, we rely heavily on our visual system, and we intuitively grasp “tangible” concepts than more abstract ones. Because of this, my teaching style tends toward being more practical and based around using tools, tools that I use in front of the learners that they then use along with me, so they <em>see exactly</em> how to do some task or apply some knowledge, rather than abstractly think how they would use the knowledge and skills. We humans also remember by doing and, because we evolved as social animals, work best with others. For these reasons, I incorporate real-world datasets to practice on and when possible include group work activities.</p>
<p>Other benefits of using this live coding style are that instructors are forced to slow down with their instruction because it takes time to type for both the instructor and the learners, and learners get hands-on practice working with the concepts being taught. Because it slows down the pace of the course, it really forces the instructor/curriculum developer to think about how much code and related concepts can be taught in a given time. So in many ways, it leads to less total content covered and narrows the focus of the content on the minimum content that instructors actually want the learners to learn. Plus, with the interspersed exercises, curriculum is generally developed from the point of view of “what should the learners actually accomplish”, and then creates the content around that.</p>
<p>Essentially, my role as a teacher is simple: To facilitate the learning of skills and knowledge in the learner. I don’t come from a “higher/superior” place of “expertise”, but rather help them to learn what they came to the course to learn. My role as a teacher is also to bring awareness to learners on better practices in doing data analysis and on criticisms of current/common practices.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-approach-teaching" class="section level2">
<h2>How do I approach teaching?</h2>
<p>To effectively be a good teacher and to create good teaching activities/content, I need to approach teaching as I approach my research: as a scientific endeavour that requires experimentation, critical evaluation, and refining. To do this, I must stay informed and updated on the research and science of learning; be aware of society’s current needs and demands to stay relevant in an ever-changing world; continually seek peer and learner feedback, as well as my own self-reflection; and, to use these sources of information to improve the teaching material and content. At any given time, I know that my teaching and content will never be perfect. But at least through these actions, I can work towards making it better and that it has its intended learning effect and facilitates learning as best as possible.</p>
<p>I’m a firm advocate of anything open: open source, open data, open science, and open education. Because of this belief, all of my educational material is easily accessible online and usually has its own website. This has several advantages: learners can very easily find the course details and content, they can easily reuse the material even after the course, I can very easily update the material and all learners will instantly have access to the most up-to-date material, and it provides a role model for learners to see that being open (as researchers) is possible and that it is not as difficult as it may seem.</p>

<div id="description-and-documentation" class="section level1">
<h1>Description and documentation</h1>
<!-- 
In this part, you present your teaching experience and qualifications. Give an
overview of what you have done. We also recommend that you briefly introduce and
summarize these descriptive elements, stating what they indicate about your
current teaching experience, so that they do not just stand alone without
interpretation.
-->
<div id="teaching-completed" class="section level2">
<h2>Teaching completed</h2>
<!-- Required -->
<p>As can be seen in the table below, I’ve taught a large number of courses, workshops, short teaching sessions as well as helped with many others. Much of my experience has been on teaching computing skills to researchers of all levels. Likewise, most of these teaching activities are volunteer based or initiated and developed by myself and other colleagues. For instance, all the Software Carpentry workshops were instructed by volunteers and not part of most of the instructors “official duties”. Only for the Teaching Assistant roles were my experiences officially part of any academic programme. The reason I’ve mostly done volunteered/unofficial academic teaching activities is due to the fact that most universities do not place much value on any teaching that focuses on tools (e.g. learning to use the R statistical programming language) but rather aim to teach concepts instead. I personally believe this does a huge disservice to students and any who may continue on to do research. I quite passionately believe that learning of concepts and tools go hand-in-hand, hence why I spend a large portion of time teaching and developing “non-official” content.</p>

<h2>Experience with course management/responsibility</h2>
<!-- Required -->
<p>As I described more above, I believe strongly in the need to teach tools in combination with concepts. Given that official academic programmes favour concepts and discourage teaching specific tools, most of my teaching time ends up going to developing teaching material (since it doesn’t exist) and initiating and coordinating courses and workshops on these topics. For instance, at the University of Toronto during my PhD, myself and a group of similar minded PhD students developed an idea for a course teaching the R statistical language to undergraduate students. We initiated a conversation with several departments across the University about the idea and only the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology was interested in having the course as part of their official curriculum. They loved the idea and agreed to try the course as a pilot. So we developed the course, taught it, and managed all aspects of the course, including grading and developing the assignments and final project. It was such a success the Department created a new course code for it and it has been taught three years in a row.</p>
<p>Another course I’ve developed and managed is a 3-day intensive course for the Danish Diabetes Academy. This course was based on some teaching material I’ve slowly developed over the years and based on a dream I’ve had for running a course like this for PhD and Postdocs. I have been the primary coordinator, curriculum developer, and lead instructor of the course. The course was first offered last year and I’ve also taught a version of it for the German Diabetes Center in Potsdam. The course was a huge success and got really great feedback from the participants that the Danish Diabetes Academy wants me to run the course again every year for as long as I can. They also requested I develop and teach a more advanced version to be also taught every year.</p>

<h2>Courses completed in university or other pedagogical courses</h2>
<!-- Required -->
<p>I strongly believe in staying up-to-date on best practices in being an effective teacher. I’ve taken a formal teaching training course at the University of Toronto while I was doing my PhD studies (which was very similar to the AU Teachers Training program). I’ve also been participated in teacher training courses with the Software and Data Carpentry organizations and been certified as official instructors for them. Both are global, not-for-profit organizations dedicated to teaching researchers computing skills. Given my focus on teaching research computing skills and knowledge, these were both valuable training courses that ensure I am applying the best tools necessary when teaching these skills.</p>

<h2>Experience with working in teams of teachers</h2>
<!-- Optional -->
<p>Generally, most of my teaching is done with other teachers as the workshops tend to be multi-day events and require multiple instructors teaching different sessions. However, I have and had two particular teaching experiences I want to highlight that exemplify, to me, a truly team-based environment:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A project creating several teaching books called Merely Useful (<a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/" class="uri">https://merely-useful.github.io/</a>), which is not listed in any of the tables yet as it is still ongoing. This project has a team of 10-12 teachers from across the global to develop four semester-long teaching material books for introduction and advanced courses for R and Python (programming languages) aimed at non-computer science learners. We work collaboratively by using tools like Zoom for bi-weekly video meetings, Slack for text-based communication, and GitHub for developing the teaching material.</li>
<li>The previously mentioned semester long course on R for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (<a href="https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/" class="uri">https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/</a>) at the University of Toronto (UofT) with the UofTCoders. During a conference in London where three other members of the UofTCoders were showcasing how we developed our community, we got inspired by some of the other talks and brainstormed a semester-long course on teaching R to undergraduate students. Afterwards, we expanded our team to 6 members (all who were part of the UofTCoders) and started developing the course structure and contacted multiple departments at UofT to see who would be interested in incorporating the course into their curriculum. The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology was very interested and from there we fully developed the course (all through GitHub) and taught it to upper-year undergraduate students.</li>

<h1>Reasons for your didactic choices</h1>
<!-- 
Here you should demonstrate how and why you have taught in a particular way
through evidence and reflection. The portfolio should contain one or two
commented examples of your teaching. Keep in mind that your comments on the
example are the most important aspect and that there is a page limit.

Use a course or teaching you are proud of. Briefly describe your teaching
development work, linking to any documents as necessary.
It is important that this section of your portfolio contains:

1. A short, informative description of the course. Ensure the reader/assessor
has a clear picture of the context around the course. It is often useful if all
five elements of the didactic pentagon (content, intended learning outcomes,
examination form, teaching and learning activities, media) are described, and
the subject, course level, ECTS, class size, etc. are included.

2. Your reasons for your didactic choices and your reflections
will revolve around how and why you made those choices. The point is to link
your choices in the teaching example with your reflections on what you consider
important in teaching and learning. Describe the example concisely and show who
you are as a teacher. 

After working on the draft of the commented examples, you can continue with the
results.
-->
<p>As I’ve briefly described in my teaching philosophy, I use a participatory live coding style of teaching, interspersed with short independent and group exercises and, if the course format allows it, all linked together with a group project. The best demonstration of this style is with my 3-day workshop. I’m particularly proud of this material, because it largely reflects how I believe data analysis should be done (in health research anyway), how it should be taught, and informed by my years of teaching experiences and training. It’s also a course that I’ve largely developed and structured on my own. All the development is publicly visible (<a href="https://gitlab.com/lwjohnst/dda-rcourse" class="uri">https://gitlab.com/lwjohnst/dda-rcourse</a>) and following principles of good open source practices for contributorship. After teaching it twice, in two different settings, I decided to separate the content from the specific course level information (e.g. where the course will be taught, who is teaching, exact schedule). So I now develop the content in a different location (<a href="https://gitlab.com/rostools/r-cubed" class="uri">https://gitlab.com/rostools/r-cubed</a>).</p>
<div id="example-3-day-course-introducing-reproducible-research-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Example: 3-day course introducing reproducible research in R</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Title</em>: Reproducible Research in R: An introductory course on modern data analyses and workflows</li>
<li><em>Basic description</em>: Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly demanded of scientists and researchers. Training on how to apply these practices in data analysis has not kept up with demand. With this course, we hope to begin meeting that demand. Course has about 25-30 PhD students and postdoctoral researchers (sometimes including some professors). No ECTS credits are officially assigned (the course so far is hosted by the Danish Diabetes Academy).</li>
<li><em>Content</em>: Because this is an introductory course on data analysis, I’ve structured the course to cover the basics of using R (a programming language) and RStudio (an interface to R), how to work with data, how to visualize data, how to setup a data analysis project, how to write reproducible reports, and how to track changes to files and work collaboratively. Example datasets used in the course are openly accessible health-related datasets.</li>
<li><em>Learning outcomes</em>:
<ul>
<li>Explain what an open and reproducible data analysis workflow is, what it looks like, and why it is important.</li>
<li>Explain and demonstrate why R is rapidly becoming the standard program of choice for doing modern data analysis in science.</li>
<li>Demonstrate and apply collaborative tools and techniques when working in team settings (including working with your future self).</li>
<li>Show and apply the fundamental tools and skills for conducting a reproducible and modern analysis for a research project.</li>
<li>Show where to go to get help and to continue learning modern data analysis skills.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Examination form</em>: No grades are officially needed (it isn’t a university course). However, to assess if they have learned the content, I have the learners complete a group project. They must create a report showing all the skills they learned during the course and give a short presentation on the report on the last day.</li>
<li><em>Teaching and learning activities</em>: Participatory live coding (instructor types and explains what is happening, while learners type along too), hands-on exercises (individually and also in groups), short lectures covering basic concepts of some of the material, and group project. Learners must complete a short pre-course assignment to get introduced to some of the main topics, to make sure everything is installed correctly, and to be ready for the course.</li>
<li><em>Media</em>: Live demonstrations of skills on instructor’s computer that is shown on a projector; material, instructions, and exercises are online; slides for the short lectures; and, Mentimeter/Google Forms for getting feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>This course in particular really shows off what I belief is good teaching. My teaching activities are practical, hands-on, interactive, and collaborative. I incorporate open principles throughout the course: open education as the content is freely and openly available online; open source for the coding; and open data since activities use openly available datasets. Because the instructors (myself included) code in R live, there is always the chance that the instructor makes mistakes. This is actually an ideal situation since learners can see the instructors, not as “perfect users” of R, but as humans like them who make mistakes. Hopefully this motivates rather than demotivates them to keep trying to learn and use R even when they encounter problems, thus <em>facilitating learning</em> further. To mimic real-world settings, I get the learners to work in teams, to write a report that would mimic what they would do in their daily work, and to use real (and open) datasets. I constantly improve the course based on the feedback I receive after getting them to complete a survey.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>
<!-- 
Demonstrate what you've achieved in your teaching, in the form of student
evaluations, references, or other indicators of teaching quality, as well as
your interpretive comments.

- Student evaluations with the lecturer’s own comments and considerations (from
two different classes)
- References from, for example, the director of studies, the head of department,
course managers or co-instructors in connection with pedagogical development.
- Other indicators of teaching quality, e.g. level of activity, completion
rates, absence, average marks etc.
-->
<p>Because much of my teaching experience has been in volunteer and non-official academic settings, I don’t have much “formal” student evaluations and references. However, I always collect feedback from the learners of my courses.</p>
<p>Most often the feedback I get is full of praise and joy at having attended the course. A large portion of feedback emphasize how much they loved the live coding (“code along”) and how they loved the material being accessible on a website.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Luke’s disposition to explain and good environment. Always willing to stop the class to help the ones who were behind. The detail webpage with the contents was very nice, in general, the organization of the course was very good. THANK YOU! :)”</p>
<p>“Final [session] exercises are quite complicated and required to remember the stuff from the whole day and sometimes from previous days. That’s good, because shows gaps which have to be filled/repeated using course materials.”</p>
<p>“The course atmosphere is very nice and friendly with constantly supporting by Luke. Totally, I’m very happy with a course!”</p>
<p>“It is super to have the github website with EVERYTHING on it. I think it works very well with the write along sessions. Also that the exercises are not too long, so the momentum keeps going.”</p>
<p>“The coding along was very good. And it has been great that there has been so many helpers. Good with both lecturers and coding along and good to refresh what was thaught the day before. Very cool that everything is on the homepage…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I of course get feedback on things to improve. Almost always, I get comments that the lesson was too fast or too slow. It is a constant balancing act to get the right speed. I often struggle with communicating and demonstrating version control and Git to the learners, since it is such a foreign and complex (but important) topic for most beginners, and this is shown in the feedback I get.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The … session, that was not completely well structured, was the session about Git. You could explain a little more about the basic principles and how it works before doing examples in R.”</p>
<p>“sometimes it was hard to follow and to really understand everything because I was not fast enough in writing the code. so I just copied it from the material. So there should be some more time to write the code and understand what you actually write.”</p>
<p>“For the version control section, please slow down a bit.”</p>
<p>“Maybe have more time for exercises.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from the feedback, learners of the course were generally very engaged, motivated, and highly interested in participating. Registration for the course always has a wait list and with many more people that want to attend than we can provide for.</p>

# Appendices

## Appendix: Course evaluations

<!--
The AU guidelines indicate that the portfolio must contain evaluations from two
different classes. Since you will most likely use your teaching portfolio to
apply for an associate professorship (or another teaching position), you should,
of course, present yourself in the best possible light.

Course evaluations of courses to which you have contributed, but are not
responsible for, are quite acceptable as evidence of student evaluations. The
evaluation need not be specifically about you. However, if you have completed
your own evaluations of your teaching, these are clearly more relevant.

Finally, do not attach the evaluation forms for each student or minutes of
meetings. Make a summary of the evaluations and attach it - and explain what you
think the evaluations say about your teaching and what conclusions you make
about your teaching, the students’ learning, and your further development from
the evaluations. How will you use the evaluations to improve your teaching?
Remember, numbers never interpret themselves.
-->
<!--
## Appendix: Other results

<!--
Other observations made at the end of a course can also be important indicators
of the results you have achieved: high levels of activity face to face and/or on
Blackboard, large numbers of submitted assignments, high grades, a high level of
student performance on oral presentations, etc.

In addition, you may attach statements / recommendations from the supervisor,
department head, or course coordinator. This element in the portfolio is highly
bound to the traditions of the individual departments. At some departments, this
will be common, while at others this will not be done. Follow the tradition at
the department. Please note, however, that many Anglo-Saxon universities
appreciate the opinions of the dean and directors of studies, etc.

The university guidelines indicate that the assessment committees must be aware
of the inherent limitations of evaluations and statements / recommendations by
students, colleagues, supervisors or directors of studies. We therefore
recommend that you

<li id="fn1"><p>Participatory live coding is where the instructor types out the programming language code and describes what it is doing, while the learners also follow along and type out the code as well.
